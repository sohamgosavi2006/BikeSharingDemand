⚙️ Features Implemented --->

The dataset contains daily bike-sharing data with features such as:
1.) Datetime: Date and time of recording
2.) Season: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter
3.) Weather: Clear, Cloudy, Light Snow, Rain
4.) Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed
5.) Holiday & Working Day Indicators
6.) Count: Number of bikes rented (target variable)

📊 Results --->

Final model achieved an R² score of ~0.80 on the test set, indicating strong predictive power.
Important factors influencing bike demand: season, temperature, humidity, and working days.
Model helps in understanding demand patterns for efficient resource allocation in bike-sharing systems.
